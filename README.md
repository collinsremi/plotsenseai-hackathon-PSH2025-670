# 🌍 Air Quality Insights & Prediction

**Hackathon Submission – Plotsense Challenge**

---

## 📌 Overview

Urban air pollution is a major global health challenge. This project analyzes a large dataset of air quality metrics across 20+ cities worldwide, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds a machine learning model to classify **Air Quality Index (AQI)** categories.

The project demonstrates how **Plotsense** accelerates data storytelling and visualization during hackathon settings, and how these insights can be extended into an **interactive Streamlit app** for real-world usability.

## 🚀 What We Did

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values and validated pollutant ranges.
* Added AQI sub-indices for **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3** using EPA breakpoints.
* Created a consolidated **AQI Category** column (`Good`, `Moderate`, `Unhealthy-Sensitive`, `Unhealthy`, `Very Unhealthy`).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Plotsense**

We leveraged Plotsense’s tools to generate and explain plots efficiently:

* **`recommender`** → Suggested the best plots for AQI and pollutant distributions.
* **`plotgen`** → Auto-generated high-quality visualizations (bar, box, scatter, pie).
* **`explainer`** → Produced Markdown-ready insights for each visualization.

#### Examples:

* **Null Value Analysis** → Bar chart showing completeness of data.
* **Distribution of AQI Categories** → Pie chart with health-based interpretation.
* **Pollutant Correlation** → Scatter plot (e.g., NO2 vs PM10) with correlation analysis.
* **City Comparisons** → Boxplots for PM10 and PM2.5 across 20 major cities.

Plotsense turned these into **publication-ready Markdown explanations**, saving time and helping us focus on insights.

### 3. Handling Imbalanced Data

* Observed that “Good” AQI rows were rare (<1%).
* Created **synthetic samples** for `Good`, `Moderate`, and `Unhealthy-Sensitive` categories using controlled random generation.
* Ensured balance across AQI categories for model training.

---

### 4. Machine Learning Pipeline

We built a classification pipeline to predict **AQI Category**:

* **Preprocessing**

  * Encoded categorical variables (`City`, `Country`) using `LabelEncoder`.
  * Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

* **Modeling**

  * Chose **XGBoost Classifier** (`xgboost.XGBClassifier`) for its robustness on tabular data.
  * Trained using an **80/20 train-test split**.

* **Evaluation**

  * Classification report converted into a **pandas DataFrame** for analysis.
  * Reported accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across AQI categories.

### 5. Interactive Streamlit App 🌐

To make the results accessible beyond notebooks, we built and deployed a **Streamlit dashboard**:

* **Upload Data** → Load and preview CSV datasets directly in the app.
* **View Saved Plots** → Browse plots generated by Plotsense with corresponding explanations.
* **Make Predictions** → Input pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and predict the **AQI Category** using the trained ML model.

This bridges the gap between **data science workflows** and **user-friendly insights**, making the project practical and interactive.

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA

* Over **80% of observations** fall into **Unhealthy** or **Very Unhealthy** categories.
* **NO2 and PM10** show a strong positive correlation (Pearson’s r ≈ 0.78).
* Asian cities (e.g., Bangkok, Mumbai) exhibit higher median PM levels compared to European/North American cities.
* “Good” air quality is virtually absent, emphasizing global air pollution concerns.

## 💡 Why This Matters

* **For Public Health:** Provides an early-warning system to highlight health risks.
* **For Policymakers:** Offers evidence for targeted interventions in cities with persistent high AQI.
* **For the Hackathon:** Demonstrates how **Plotsense tools** streamline the process from raw data → visualization → storytelling → deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, xgboost
* **Visualization & Insights:** **Plotsense (recommender, plotgen, explainer)**
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Incorporate time-series forecasting for AQI prediction.
* Automate daily AQI dashboards with Plotsense integration.
* Expand to real-time streaming data from IoT sensors.
