- The countries and their corresponding percentages are:
  - USA: 9.6%
  - India: 9.6%
  - Mexico: 4.6%
  - Russia: 4.9%
  - Australia: 4.9%
  - China: 4.8%

  - Germany: 5.2%
  - UAE: 5.2%
  - South Korea: 5.4%
  - South Africa: 5.2%

## Insights and Patterns
- The USA and India together account for 19.2% of the total distribution, indicating a significant concentration.
- The average percentage value across all 20 countries is approximately 5%, suggesting a relatively even distribution among the remaining 18 countries.
- The standard deviation of the percentage values is about 0.34%, indicating a low to moderate level of variation among the countries.
- Countries like South Korea (5.4%) and Egypt (5.1%) have slightly higher percentages, while Mexico (4.6%) and China (4.8%) have slightly lower percentages, indicating some variation.
- Several countries have similar percentage values, clustering around the average:
  - Group 1 (around 4.9%): UK, France, Japan, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and Australia.
  - Group 2 (around 5.2%): Spain, Canada, Germany, UAE, and South Africa.

## Quantitative Insights
- Total percentage of the top 2 countries (USA and India): 19.2%.
- Average percentage of the top 5 countries: (9.6 + 9.6 + 5.4 + 5.2 + 5.2) / 5 = 7.0%.
- Average percentage of the remaining 15 countries: approximately 4.8%.
- Median percentage: 4.9% (indicating that half of the countries have a percentage above or equal to 4.9%).
- Interquartile range (IQR): 0.3% (Q3 - Q1 = 5.2% - 4.9% = 0.3%), indicating a relatively small spread in the middle 50% of the data.

## Conclusion
The pie chart provides a visual representation of the distribution of an unspecified variable across 20 countries. While the USA and India have the largest shares, the remaining countries are relatively evenly distributed around the average percentage of 5%. The low to moderate standard deviation and small IQR indicate some variation, but the overall distribution is fairly balanced. Further analysis or context is needed to understand the implications of these distributions fully.
